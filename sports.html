        <h2>Sports</h2>
        <p>I play various sports such as Volleyball, Basketball, Table Tennis, and more. Each sport challenges me in different ways.</p>
            <p>Volleyball allows me to focus on quick reflexes, teamwork, and powerful spikes to stay ahead. Basketball pushes me to 
        improve my agility, accuracy, and defensive skills. Table tennis helps sharpen my hand-eye coordination and reaction speed,
        especially when controlling spins and fast rallies. Chess helps with my patience and strategic thinking, helping me stay calm
        under pressure. Swimming builds my endurance and strength, making me more disciplined and focused.</p>
